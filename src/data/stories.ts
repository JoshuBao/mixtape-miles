    fullStory: `We met Benjamin as he was taking a quick smoke and espresso break outside of The Daily Grind Espresso Bar. When asked our staple question about a song that reminded him of growing up, Ben answered quickly, a sense of nostalgia passing over him.

"Going to California" by Led Zeppelin. Originally from Illinois, Benjamin found himself watching the sunset dipping below the Lake Michigan horizon at 27 years old. Recently free from the grips of alcohol, he searched for a new horizon for himself.

Listening to "Going to California" it spoke to him, capturing his moment of change to a new chapter. When a nearby friend asked Benjamin where he was going next, he knew what to say. "I'm going as far west as I can."

Now, settled with his son in Southern Humboldt County, "Going to California" marks a new beginning, the journey to his fresh start in the west.`,

    fullStory: `We met Mike and Ann during our hike on the Drury-Chaney Trail, as they were the first people we had run into in about a mile through the redwood canopy. 

Mike and Ann are from Houston, Texas, but are on their 4-month long road trip through the west coast in their mobile home. Their last road trip was 6 months and went all the way to Alaska! They both have a deep love for photography, which draws them to all the national parks to capture the beauties of nature through a lens.

When asked for a song that reminds them of growing up, they both thought deeply before their response. Mike answered, "Night Moves" by Bob Segar because he can truly feel the way it moves him. It reminds him of the first time he heard it, in the 1970s on the radio.

Ann loves "Respect" by Aretha Franklin since she always heard it growing up. She loved the way it empowered girls of the time, before the Women's movement began.`,

    fullStory: `We met 71 year old Gary when exploring the Old Town Eureka area, inside of an antique store, just off the main road. Cluttered with an entourage of antique treasures, we squeezed through the aisles to glance through the bins of pieces before running into Gary. 

When asked for a song that reminded him of growing up, Gary nodded, thinking to himself before saying "Stairway to Heaven" by Led Zeppelin. Gary first heard it in the 70s as a young teenager from his friend Bob Yager's record player. He loved going over and listening to their collection of record vinyls together. 

Offering more of his story, Gary shared that he has been in Eureka his whole life, first a carpenter for 23 years before his wife got tired of his garage sale findings collection and opened up an antique store for him. After she stayed home with their two babies, he took over the store. Now, 35 years later, he still resides in Eureka, selling antiques to locals and tourists that pass through the area.`,

    fullStory: `We met Joe as we passed by another local store in the Eureka area. To our question about a song that reminded him of growing up, Joe gave a quick contemplation before settling on "White Room" by Cream. 

He heard it constantly on the radio throughout his childhood as his Mom and Dad always emphasized it to him as it played. "It's a banger." Joe expressed that he has always loved the way it sounds, but as he grew older and learned how to play the drums, the way he listened changed slightly. 

He hears and feels more of the elaborate drumming sequences in the songs, bringing a new enjoyment to his listening.`,

    shortStory: 'At 67, James has had three careers: environmental chemist, fine wine dealer, and now a planning forester for the Yurok Tribe. Originally from St. Louis, his journey took him across the country before settling in California.',
    fullStory: `We met James while hiking through the redwoods in Humboldt, all of us stopped at a creek trying to find a dry way across. When we asked what song reminded him of growing up, he answered after careful deliberation: &quot;Tea for the Tillerman&quot; by Yusuf / Cat Stevens.

Originally from St. Louis, James always felt drawn to California. His journey took him from college in New England to travels in Europe, then finally to Sebastopol to raise his kids. Now 67, he works as a planning forester for the Yurok Tribe and wears a Triquetra around his neck—a Celtic knot representing the power of the spirit.

James has had three careers: environmental chemist, fine wine dealer for 25 years—including one shipment of 50 cases to the Moscow Air Show—and now, a forester after returning to school later in life. &quot;Tea for the Tillerman&quot; holds it all together for him—a song about transitions, roots, and a life of quiet direction.`,

    fullStory: `We ran into Chung Li as he was wobbling on a thin log, as he was, like us, trying to find a way around the flowing creek in the middle of our redwoods hike. He was with James, an old friend from their college days at Humboldt state, whose story you can find above. When asked for a song that reminded him of growing up, Chung quickly whispered, &quot;anime&quot; before pondering through several specifics to conclude on &quot;Wind&quot; by Akeboshi as it was the theme song for Naruto.

Originally from Chengdu, China, Chung is 29 and studying for his doctorate in music at the University of Missouri–Kansas City, focusing on classical piano. Quiet and composed, Chung carries the same kind of calm found in the song he chose—familiar, reflective, and full of memory.`,

    fullStory: `We met 18-year-old Angel Marquez at SeaQuake Brewing in Crescent City, California, when we stopped in for a delicious dinner. It was his very first shift as a waiter, though the place already felt like home—his older sibling worked there before him, and his dad still bakes the bread for the menu.

When we asked Angel what song reminded him of growing up, he smiled and said, &quot;505&quot; by Arctic Monkeys. He first heard it in 8th grade during quarantine—a time that, in his words, felt like life just skipped a year. A girl he liked back then, Presley, had introduced him to the track. Though he says she &quot;brutally rejected&quot; him, Angel&apos;s love for the song stuck.

Now a high school senior, Angel plans to attend community college and dreams of transferring to a university in San Diego. As we devoured some of SeaQuake&apos;s crispy Brussels by the Bay (a SeaQuake favorite), Angel shared his hope of becoming a math teacher. &quot;505&quot; lingers in his memory as a song from a strange, in-between time—bittersweet, full of feeling, and still part of the soundtrack to where he&apos;s headed next.`,

    songTitle: 'Three Little Birds / Sloop John B / Stayin\' Alive',
    artist: 'Bob Marley / The Beach Boys / Bee Gees',
    location: 'Rocky Overlook, Oregon Coast',
    shortStory: 'We met this family during our coastal hike in Oregon. Each had their own song: Sara with Bob Marley\'s road trip anthem, Alan with the first song he learned on guitar, and 14-year-old Coco with the Bee Gees classic that soundtracked their family drives.',
    fullStory: `We met Sara, Alan, and their daughter Coco at a rocky overlook along the Oregon coast. We had just wrapped up a coastal hike and stopped to take in the view; they were seated nearby, finishing up lunch and admiring the same wide stretch of Pacific horizon. A shared pause in the day turned into a conversation about music, memory, and the songs that stay with us.

Sara&apos;s song was &quot;Three Little Birds&quot; by Bob Marley. Her dad used to play it on loop during their yearly road trips from California down to Baja—a tradition that started when she was just six months old. It wasn&apos;t until she was around seven that she remembers really hearing it, the lyrics settling in as something familiar and comforting. Now a mother herself, she tries to take her own family on that same drive each year, continuing the ritual. Sara is a West Coast-based artist whose work—vibrant, coastal-inspired jewelry and paintings—can be found at sararenedesigns.com. Her art, like the song, feels rooted in sunlight, rhythm, and the joy of simple things.

Alan chose &quot;Sloop John B&quot; by The Beach Boys—the first song he ever learned to play from a guitar songbook. It marked the beginning of a lifelong relationship with music. These days, he plays in an Americana style but has continued his passion for guitar playing. Now working for the US Forest Service, Alan still finds time to play shows and explore music on the side.

Their daughter Coco, 14 years old, picked &quot;Stayin&apos; Alive&quot; by the Bee Gees. She said she loves the beat, and grew up always hearing it on the radio. It marks as a background song to their long drives as a family with the windows down and radio playing.

Three different songs from three different memories, but all part of the same view, the same moment, and one really lovely pause along the road.`,
