    fullStory: `We met Benjamin as he was taking a quick smoke and espresso break outside of The Daily Grind Espresso Bar. When asked our staple question about a song that reminded him of growing up, Ben answered quickly, a sense of nostalgia passing over him.

"Going to California" by Led Zeppelin. Originally from Illinois, Benjamin found himself watching the sunset dipping below the Lake Michigan horizon at 27 years old. Recently free from the grips of alcohol, he searched for a new horizon for himself.

Listening to "Going to California" it spoke to him, capturing his moment of change to a new chapter. When a nearby friend asked Benjamin where he was going next, he knew what to say. "I'm going as far west as I can."

Now, settled with his son in Southern Humboldt County, "Going to California" marks a new beginning, the journey to his fresh start in the west.`,

    fullStory: `We met Mike and Ann during our hike on the Drury-Chaney Trail, as they were the first people we had run into in about a mile through the redwood canopy. 

Mike and Ann are from Houston, Texas, but are on their 4-month long road trip through the west coast in their mobile home. Their last road trip was 6 months and went all the way to Alaska! They both have a deep love for photography, which draws them to all the national parks to capture the beauties of nature through a lens.

When asked for a song that reminds them of growing up, they both thought deeply before their response. Mike answered, "Night Moves" by Bob Segar because he can truly feel the way it moves him. It reminds him of the first time he heard it, in the 1970s on the radio.

Ann loves "Respect" by Aretha Franklin since she always heard it growing up. She loved the way it empowered girls of the time, before the Women's movement began.`,

When asked for a song that reminded him of growing up, Gary nodded, thinking to himself before saying "Stairway to Heaven" by Led Zeppelin. Gary first heard it in the 70s as a young teenager from his friend Bob Yager's record player. He loved going over and listening to their collection of record vinyls together. 

Offering more of his story, Gary shared that he has been in Eureka his whole life, first a carpenter for 23 years before his wife got tired of his garage sale findings collection and opened up an antique store for him. After she stayed home with their two babies, he took over the store. Now, 35 years later, he still resides in Eureka, selling antiques to locals and tourists that pass through the area.`,

He hears and feels more of the elaborate drumming sequences in the songs, bringing a new enjoyment to his listening.`,

    fullStory: `We met Lisa at the Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park Visitor Center while looking for a good trail to hike for the afternoon. Outside, the fields were dotted with elk, and the sound of nearby creeks echoed through the trees, an already magical stop before we even stepped onto the trail.

When we asked what song reminded her of growing up, Lisa chose "Verde River" by Kassi Valazza. She first heard it about four years ago, around the time she really got into country music. What made the song stick wasn't just the sound, but the story behind it‚ÄîKassi, who grew up near where Lisa's from in Arizona, wrote the song about a river she visited often. Lisa said it reminds her of home.

Originally from Prescott, Arizona, Lisa spent most of her life there before serving in the military for six years. She moved to the redwoods five years ago for a fresh start and never looked back. Now 39, she studied at Cal Poly Humboldt and has been working at the visitor center for the past year, helping travelers like us find their way into the trees.

"Verde River" is more than just a song for Lisa. It's a reminder of the landscapes that shaped her, and how the places we come from stay with us, even as we carve out new homes among the redwoods.`,

Now 67, he works as a planning forester for the Yurok Tribe and wears a Triquetra around his neck‚Äîa Celtic knot representing the power of the spirit.

James has had three careers: environmental chemist, fine wine dealer for 25 years‚Äîincluding one shipment of 50 cases to the Moscow Air Show‚Äîand now, a forester after returning to school later in life.

It was his very first shift as a waiter, though the place already felt like home‚Äîhis older sibling worked there before him, and his dad still bakes the bread for the menu.

When we asked Angel what song reminded him of growing up, he smiled and said, "505" by Arctic Monkeys. He first heard it in 8th grade during quarantine‚Äîa time that, in his words, felt like life just skipped a year. A girl he liked back then, Presley, had introduced him to the track. Though he says she "brutally rejected" him, Angel's love for the song stuck.

Now a high school senior, Angel plans to attend community college and dreams of transferring to a university in San Diego. As we devoured some of SeaQuake's crispy Brussels by the Bay (a SeaQuake favorite), Angel shared his hope of becoming a math teacher.

    fullStory: `We met Sara, Alan, and their daughter Coco at a rocky overlook along the Oregon coast. We had just wrapped up a coastal hike and stopped to take in the view; they were seated nearby, finishing up lunch and admiring the same wide stretch of Pacific horizon. A shared pause in the day turned into a conversation about music, memory, and the songs that stay with us.

Sara's song was "Three Little Birds" by Bob Marley. Her dad used to play it on loop during their yearly road trips from California down to Baja‚Äîa tradition that started when she was just six months old. It wasn't until she was around seven that she remembers really hearing it, the lyrics settling in as something familiar and comforting. Now a mother herself, she tries to take her own family on that same drive each year, continuing the ritual. Sara is a West Coast-based artist whose work‚Äîvibrant, coastal-inspired jewelry and paintings‚Äîcan be found at sararenedesigns.com. Her art, like the song, feels rooted in sunlight, rhythm, and the joy of simple things.

Alan chose "Sloop John B" by The Beach Boys‚Äîthe first song he ever learned to play from a guitar songbook. It marked the beginning of a lifelong relationship with music. These days, he plays in an Americana style but has continued his passion for guitar playing. Now working for the US Forest Service, Alan still finds time to play shows and explore music on the side.

Their daughter Coco, 14 years old, picked "Stayin' Alive" by the Bee Gees. She said she loves the beat, and grew up always hearing it on the radio. It marks as a background song to their long drives as a family with the windows down and radio playing.

Three different songs from three different memories, but all part of the same view, the same moment, and one really lovely pause along the road.`,

    shortStory: 'Newly met potential neighbors Linnea and Tracy share songs from their pasts: Linnea\'s life of reinvention across California and Tracy\'s journey from Half Moon Bay to Hawaii, now possibly returning to Oregon.',
    fullStory: `We met Linnea and Tracy at the Natural Bridges Viewpoint on the Oregon Coast. They were standing side by side on the wooden platform overlooking the sea when we crossed paths, stopping to admire the beautiful view before heading out for a short hike. The conversation began with a compliment to Linnea's dog, Numi‚Äîa shy rescue mutt she had adopted, name and all, from the Humane Society.

Despite seeming like longtime friends, we soon learned that Linnea and Tracy had only met that day! Tracy was visiting Brookings, Oregon from Kauai, Hawaii where she's lived for the past 20 years after moving there post-retirement to be with her best friend. She was touring a home next door to Linnea's, hoping to leave the noise of Kauai behind for something quieter. Linnea had taken it upon herself to give Tracy the unofficial tour of Brookings, hoping she might become her future next-door neighbor. As we stood looking out at the ocean together, the conversation turned to music and the songs that reminded the two of where they journeyed from.

Linnea chose "Old Man" by Neil Young. She first heard it when she was 11 or 12, during road trips from San Pedro, Los Angeles up to Mammoth. Her life has moved all over California: through college at SDSU and UCLA, marriage and divorce, and a string of unexpected career turns. Linnea started as an interior designer for 10 years before becoming a farrier, shoeing horses, and finally following in her fathers footsteps as a longshoreman, loading and unloading ships at the ports of LA and Long Beach. Now, after a lifetime of reinvention, Linnea has found a quieter rhythm in Brookings‚Äîretired, grounded, and content with her rescue dog Numi by her side.

Tracy picked "California" by Joni Mitchell. Raised in Half Moon Bay, she was immersed in music from a young age‚Äîthanks in part to her older brother Bob's messy room and amazing record collection, which she'd play while being stuck with cleaning duty. Somewhere between the clutter one day, she discovered Joni Mitchell and never looked back. She knew every song, could play them all on guitar, and even hummed a few bars of "California" while telling us about it. She worked for years as a swim instructor around San Mateo before moving to Kauai with her husband, where she now rents out bikes to visitors. Tracy is 63, full of stories, and ready for her next chapter‚Ä¶ perhaps right next door to Linnea.`,

    fullStory: `We met Kiki at the Prehistoric Gardens Dinosaur Park, a roadside gem along the Southern Oregon Coast that caught our eye with its towering T-Rex statue. Curiosity pulled us off the highway and straight into Kiki's gift shop, where she welcomed us with a warm smile and a story that stretched back generations.

Kiki chose "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" by Elton John, not so much for the lyrics, but for the way the song makes her feel. She loves its tune, its rhythm, and the way it lifts her mood. It's become more meaningful as she's grown older.

Kiki has lived on the Southern Oregon Coast her entire life, and the Dinosaur Park has been part of her world since before she was born. Her grandparents opened it in the 1950s, sparked by her grandfather's childhood love of dinosaurs. In his 40s, he began building the park by hand, turning that passion into a creative legacy. Kiki never expected to take it over, it just happened. "It's alright," she said with a small smile, pointing out old black-and-white newspaper clippings from a 1958 Popular Mechanics article featuring her grandfather, along with snapshots of him posing proudly at the park.

After decades of carrying on the family legacy, Kiki is now looking ahead to retirement. First stop? A visit to her daughter in London.`,

    fullStory: `We met Ethan at Historic Wilson's Market in Bandon, Oregon, a small-town staple that has been around since 1932. We had pulled off the road for a quick taco from the deli, and Ethan greeted us with a friendly energy that matched the warm, local vibe of the shop.

Ethan is 32 and grew up in Bandon, though he has spent time in Vancouver, Washington as well. For the past five years, he has worked at Wilson's and now also splits his time with a new spot in town, Bandon Sushi. He told us he enjoys meeting new people passing through and being a familiar face in the community.

When we asked what song reminded him of growing up, Ethan chose "Boondocks" by Little Big Town. He first heard it back in middle school and it has stuck ever since. It brings him back to simple memories, like picking wheatgrass with friends and finding honey tucked inside, as mentioned in the song. That small-town pride and grounded feeling in the song has always given him a sense of nostalgia to memories.

Ethan's story is one of familiarity, hard work, and finding joy in the everyday rhythm of a place he's proud to call home.`,

    shortStory: '24-year-old Ryan works as a sandboarding instructor after five years in Fire/EMS. His chosen song brings back the few precious memories he has with his father from when he was very young.',
    fullStory: `We met Ryan at Sand Master Park in Florence, Oregon, where he was our sandboarding instructor for the afternoon. Easygoing and full of laughter, he felt like someone you could talk to for hours. As the sun dipped beneath the sand and our legs started to give out, we asked him our usual question before taking our last run.

His song was "Close to You" by The Carpenters. He first heard it around the age of three or four, playing in the background while spending time with his dad. He told us he doesn't have many memories with him, but that song has stayed‚Äîsoft and steady like the few moments he remembers clearly.

Now 24, Ryan has lived just south of Florence for the past ten years. Before that, he grew up in Vacaville and Kansas. He's been working full-time at Sand Master for about three years now and called it "the best job in the world." But before the dunes, he spent five years working in Fire/EMS just out of high school, diving into some of the hardest, most heroic work there is.

After we drove away, Ryan sent us this message. We'll let his words speak for themselves:

"Well, I'd like to touch a little bit more about my comment on working in Fire/EMS for the last 5 years...
I made a comment to y'all about how I'd been taking some relaxation time after some trauma I got my time working there, but it was truly an amazing experience all things considered."

He went on to share one memory in particular, about a house fire. After the flames were under control, he and his lieutenant noticed two kids from the family standing nearby, visibly shaken. So, with their parents' permission, Ryan let the kids spray a real fire hose from the truck, something he knew might offer them a moment of light. A week later, the station received drawings from those same kids. One read: "Thank you for saving my house. I want to be a firefighter like you."

"Often the world of Fire/EMS is full of death, sadness, trauma, and really just the worst things possible," he wrote, "but it's the moments like this that make serving the people of your community the biggest honor in the entire world."

Sometimes a song holds the gentlest part of someone's story. Sometimes the rest is shared a little later, when you least expect it.`,

    shortStory: '80-year-old Bill\'s life has taken him from the Peace Corps in Haiti and Bolivia to a career in masonry. His song choice connects to a poignant memory of a friend\'s death at high altitude in Bolivia.',
    fullStory: `We met 80-year-old Bill in the small-town center of Florence, Oregon, right on the edge of the flowing river water. He was selling a car, a red 1990 Buick Reatta V6, a car which he had purchased for his wife, who loved vintage Buicks and "he couldn't say no to her." We ended up talking with Bill for nearly an hour as he gave us valuable life perspective. He spoke slowly and intentionally, painting out details of each memory for us. Bill's life had taken him across trades, continents, and decades of hard work. After college, he served in the Peace Corps, living places such as Haiti and Bolivia. He also developed a clear passion and skillful knowledge for masonry, something he spoke about with pride, his stories full of craftmanship and care.  

When asked for a song that reminded him of growing up, Bill paused. He couldn't quite recall the name, but began to describe the way it sounded, the instruments played, and the way it felt. We searched through Spotify together and the second he heard "Bridge over troubled water," he knew it was the one.

Bill loved all the songs of Simon & Garfunkel during his time in the Peace Corps. He remembers listening to them with a friend he called "a kid," Greg, who played their music often. But that memory is also tied to heartbreak and the crashing reality of some difficult times in Bill's life. Greg died of pulmonary edema stationed at extremely high altitudes in Bolivia. His best friend, who eventually took over his masonry business, was caring for Greg when he passed and even years later, Bill could recall every detail. Bill remembers clear as day how "Bridge Over Troubled Water" sounded as he looked out a window over the highest road in Bolivia at nearly 18,000 feet, just before Greg's passing. Years later, Bill named his own son's middle name after Greg.  

For Bill, "Bridge Over Troubled Water" holds it all: youth, friendship, loss, finding yourself, and the kind of memory that doesn't fade. Some songs don't just remind us of the past, they hold memories that shape who we are.`,

    fullStory: `We met Greta at "Gluten Free Gem," a cheerful gluten free bakery tucked into Portland's Lloyd District. The space is filled with natural light and the moment the front door opened, we could feel the warmth and love inside. This love is not just in the freshly baked pastries, it's embedded in the bakery's origins. Greta's mom, Anne Miller, opened the bakery in 2011 after Greta's sister, Emma, was diagnosed with celiac disease. Determined to create treats her daughters could enjoy, Anne dived head first into perfecting gluten free recipes. The restaurant name itself is a nod to the original "Gems", her daughters Greta and Emma.

When asked for a song that reminded her of growing up, Greta giggled a little before settling on "Our House" by Madness. She remembered first hearing it at as a vibrant 6-year-old as her and her sister jumped on their parents' beds, the upbeat tune echoing through the house. Born and raised in Portland, Greta practically grew up inside the bakery. Her bright spirit, shaped by a love-filled home and a mom who turned a diagnosis into a dream, is evident in everything from her smile to the frosting on the cinnamon roll (probably the best gluten free thing I've ever had). The song, "Our House," clearly embodies her family's sprit of kindness and love that the bakery is built upon.

He specifically described his uncle showing him the "zombie music video" as a young and thinking it was creepy, but unforgettable. Carlos spent a lot of time with that uncle, who unfortunately passed away about a year ago. Carlos recalled his favorite memory as playing football with his uncle, a small act that clearly still means a lot. He believes Los Amigos is special simply because the food is good. Carlos plans on leaving the small-town life soon to work with his family in Seattle, helping with their drywall business. But something about the way he spoke of the restaurant and memories with his uncle made it clear that no matter where he goes next, a part of him will always be rooted there: in good food, family, and the "Thriller" music video in the background of growing up.`,
