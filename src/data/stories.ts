    fullStory: `We met Benjamin as he was taking a quick smoke and espresso break outside of The Daily Grind Espresso Bar. When asked our staple question about a song that reminded him of growing up, Ben answered quickly, a sense of nostalgia passing over him.

"Going to California" by Led Zeppelin. Originally from Illinois, Benjamin found himself watching the sunset dipping below the Lake Michigan horizon at 27 years old. Recently free from the grips of alcohol, he searched for a new horizon for himself.

Listening to "Going to California" it spoke to him, capturing his moment of change to a new chapter. When a nearby friend asked Benjamin where he was going next, he knew what to say. "I'm going as far west as I can."

Now, settled with his son in Southern Humboldt County, "Going to California" marks a new beginning, the journey to his fresh start in the west.`,

    fullStory: `We met Mike and Ann during our hike on the Drury-Chaney Trail, as they were the first people we had run into in about a mile through the redwood canopy. 

Mike and Ann are from Houston, Texas, but are on their 4-month long road trip through the west coast in their mobile home. Their last road trip was 6 months and went all the way to Alaska! They both have a deep love for photography, which draws them to all the national parks to capture the beauties of nature through a lens.

When asked for a song that reminds them of growing up, they both thought deeply before their response. Mike answered, "Night Moves" by Bob Segar because he can truly feel the way it moves him. It reminds him of the first time he heard it, in the 1970s on the radio.

Ann loves "Respect" by Aretha Franklin since she always heard it growing up. She loved the way it empowered girls of the time, before the Women's movement began.`,

Gary first heard it in the 70s as a young teenager from his friend Bob Yager's record player. He loved going over and listening to their collection of record vinyls together. 

Offering more of his story, Gary shared that he has been in Eureka his whole life, first a carpenter for 23 years before his wife got tired of his garage sale findings collection and opened up an antique store for him. After she stayed home with their two babies, he took over the store. Now, 35 years later, he still resides in Eureka, selling antiques to locals and tourists that pass through the area.`,

He hears and feels more of the elaborate drumming sequences in the songs, bringing a new enjoyment to his listening.`,

Outside, the fields were dotted with elk, and the sound of nearby creeks echoed through the trees, an already magical stop before we even stepped onto the trail.

When we asked what song reminded her of growing up, Lisa chose "Verde River" by Kassi Valazza. She first heard it about four years ago, around the time she really got into country music. What made the song stick wasn't just the sound, but the story behind it‚ÄîKassi, who grew up near where Lisa's from in Arizona, wrote the song about a river she visited often. Lisa said it reminds her of home.

Originally from Prescott, Arizona, Lisa spent most of her life there before serving in the military for six years. She moved to the redwoods five years ago for a fresh start and never looked back. Now 39, she studied at Cal Poly Humboldt and has been working at the visitor center for the past year, helping travelers like us find their way into the trees.

"Verde River" is more than just a song for Lisa. It's a reminder of the landscapes that shaped her, and how the places we come from stay with us, even as we carve out new homes among the redwoods.`,

It was his very first shift as a waiter, though the place already felt like home‚Äîhis older sibling worked there before him, and his dad still bakes the bread for the menu.

When we asked Angel what song reminded him of growing up, he smiled and said, "505" by Arctic Monkeys. He first heard it in 8th grade during quarantine‚Äîa time that, in his words, felt like life just skipped a year. A girl he liked back then, Presley, had introduced him to the track. Though he says she "brutally rejected" him, Angel's love for the song stuck.

Now a high school senior, Angel plans to attend community college and dreams of transferring to a university in San Diego. As we devoured some of SeaQuake's crispy Brussels by the Bay (a SeaQuake favorite), Angel shared his hope of becoming a math teacher. "505" lingers in his memory as a song from a strange, in-between time‚Äîbittersweet, full of feeling, and still part of the soundtrack to where he's headed next.`,

    fullStory: `We met Sara, Alan, and their daughter Coco at a rocky overlook along the Oregon coast. We had just wrapped up a coastal hike and stopped to take in the view; they were seated nearby, finishing up lunch and admiring the same wide stretch of Pacific horizon. A shared pause in the day turned into a conversation about music, memory, and the songs that stay with us.

Sara's song was "Three Little Birds" by Bob Marley. Her dad used to play it on loop during their yearly road trips from California down to Baja‚Äîa tradition that started when she was just six months old. It wasn't until she was around seven that she remembers really hearing it, the lyrics settling in as something familiar and comforting. Now a mother herself, she tries to take her own family on that same drive each year, continuing the ritual. Sara is a West Coast-based artist whose work‚Äîvibrant, coastal-inspired jewelry and paintings‚Äîcan be found at sararenedesigns.com. Her art, like the song, feels rooted in sunlight, rhythm, and the joy of simple things.

Alan chose "Sloop John B" by The Beach Boys‚Äîthe first song he ever learned to play from a guitar songbook. It marked the beginning of a lifelong relationship with music. These days, he plays in an Americana style but has continued his passion for guitar playing. Now working for the US Forest Service, Alan still finds time to play shows and explore music on the side.

Their daughter Coco, 14 years old, picked "Stayin' Alive" by the Bee Gees. She said she loves the beat, and grew up always hearing it on the radio. It marks as a background song to their long drives as a family with the windows down and radio playing.

Three different songs from three different memories, but all part of the same view, the same moment, and one really lovely pause along the road.`,

    shortStory: 'Newly met potential neighbors Linnea and Tracy share songs from their pasts: Linnea\'s life of reinvention across California and Tracy\'s journey from Half Moon Bay to Hawaii, now possibly returning to Oregon.',
    fullStory: `We met Linnea and Tracy at the Natural Bridges Viewpoint on the Oregon Coast. They were standing side by side on the wooden platform overlooking the sea when we crossed paths, stopping to admire the beautiful view before heading out for a short hike. The conversation began with a compliment to Linnea's dog, Numi‚Äîa shy rescue mutt she had adopted, name and all, from the Humane Society.

Despite seeming like longtime friends, we soon learned that Linnea and Tracy had only met that day! Tracy was visiting Brookings, Oregon from Kauai, Hawaii where she's lived for the past 20 years after moving there post-retirement to be with her best friend. She was touring a home next door to Linnea's, hoping to leave the noise of Kauai behind for something quieter. Linnea had taken it upon herself to give Tracy the unofficial tour of Brookings, hoping she might become her future next-door neighbor. As we stood looking out at the ocean together, the conversation turned to music and the songs that reminded the two of where they journeyed from.

Linnea chose "Old Man" by Neil Young. She first heard it when she was 11 or 12, during road trips from San Pedro, Los Angeles up to Mammoth. Her life has moved all over California: through college at SDSU and UCLA, marriage and divorce, and a string of unexpected career turns. Linnea started as an interior designer for 10 years before becoming a farrier, shoeing horses, and finally following in her fathers footsteps as a longshoreman, loading and unloading ships at the ports of LA and Long Beach. Now, after a lifetime of reinvention, Linnea has found a quieter rhythm in Brookings‚Äîretired, grounded, and content with her rescue dog Numi by her side.

Tracy picked "California" by Joni Mitchell. Raised in Half Moon Bay, she was immersed in music from a young age‚Äîthanks in part to her older brother Bob's messy room and amazing record collection, which she'd play while being stuck with cleaning duty. Somewhere between the clutter one day, she discovered Joni Mitchell and never looked back. She knew every song, could play them all on guitar, and even hummed a few bars of "California" while telling us about it. She worked for years as a swim instructor around San Mateo before moving to Kauai with her husband, where she now rents out bikes to visitors. Tracy is 63, full of stories, and ready for her next chapter‚Ä¶ perhaps right next door to Linnea.`,

Curiosity pulled us off the highway and straight into Kiki's gift shop, where she welcomed us with a warm smile and a story that stretched back generations.

Kiki chose "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" by Elton John, not so much for the lyrics, but for the way the song makes her feel. She loves its tune, its rhythm, and the way it lifts her mood. It's become more meaningful as she's grown older.

Kiki has lived on the Southern Oregon Coast her entire life, and the Dinosaur Park has been part of her world since before she was born. Her grandparents opened it in the 1950s, sparked by her grandfather's childhood love of dinosaurs. In his 40s, he began building the park by hand, turning that passion into a creative legacy. Kiki never expected to take it over, it just happened. "It's alright," she said with a small smile, pointing out old black-and-white newspaper clippings from a 1958 Popular Mechanics article featuring her grandfather, along with snapshots of him posing proudly at the park.

After decades of carrying on the family legacy, Kiki is now looking ahead to retirement. First stop? A visit to her daughter in London.`,

Ethan is 32 and grew up in Bandon, though he has spent time in Vancouver, Washington as well. For the past five years, he has worked at Wilson's and now also splits his time with a new spot in town, Bandon Sushi. He told us he enjoys meeting new people passing through and being a familiar face in the community.

When we asked what song reminded him of growing up, Ethan chose "Boondocks" by Little Big Town. He first heard it back in middle school and it has stuck ever since. It brings him back to simple memories, like picking wheatgrass with friends and finding honey tucked inside, as mentioned in the song. That small-town pride and grounded feeling in the song has always given him a sense of nostalgia to memories.

    fullStory: `We met Ryan at Sand Master Park in Florence, Oregon, where he was our sandboarding instructor for the afternoon. Easygoing and full of laughter, he felt like someone you could talk to for hours. As the sun dipped beneath the sand and our legs started to give out, we asked him our usual question before taking our last run.

His song was "Close to You" by The Carpenters. He first heard it around the age of three or four, playing in the background while spending time with his dad. He told us he doesn't have many memories with him, but that song has stayed‚Äîsoft and steady like the few moments he remembers clearly.

Now 24, Ryan has lived just south of Florence for the past ten years. Before that, he grew up in Vacaville and Kansas. He's been working full-time at Sand Master for about three years now and called it "the best job in the world." But before the dunes, he spent five years working in Fire/EMS just out of high school, diving into some of the hardest, most heroic work there is.

After we drove away, Ryan sent us this message. We'll let his words speak for themselves:

"Well, I'd like to touch a little bit more about my comment on working in Fire/EMS for the last 5 years...
I made a comment to y'all about how I'd been taking some relaxation time after some trauma I got my time working there, but it was truly an amazing experience all things considered."

He went on to share one memory in particular, about a house fire. After the flames were under control, he and his lieutenant noticed two kids from the family standing nearby, visibly shaken. So, with their parents' permission, Ryan let the kids spray a real fire hose from the truck, something he knew might offer them a moment of light. A week later, the station received drawings from those same kids. One read: "Thank you for saving my house. I want to be a firefighter like you."

"Often the world of Fire/EMS is full of death, sadness, trauma, and really just the worst things possible," he wrote, "but it's the moments like this that make serving the people of your community the biggest honor in the entire world."

Sometimes a song holds the gentlest part of someone's story. Sometimes the rest is shared a little later, when you least expect it.`,

    shortStory: '80-year-old Bill\'s life has taken him from the Peace Corps in Haiti and Bolivia to a career in masonry. His song choice connects to a poignant memory of a friend\'s death at high altitude in Bolivia.',
    fullStory: `We met 80-year-old Bill in the small-town center of Florence, Oregon, right on the edge of the flowing river water. He was selling a car, a red 1990 Buick Reatta V6, a car which he had purchased for his wife, who loved vintage Buicks and "he couldn't say no to her." We ended up talking with Bill for nearly an hour as he gave us valuable life perspective. He spoke slowly and intentionally, painting out details of each memory for us. Bill's life had taken him across trades, continents, and decades of hard work. After college, he served in the Peace Corps, living places such as Haiti and Bolivia. He also developed a clear passion and skillful knowledge for masonry, something he spoke about with pride, his stories full of craftmanship and care.  

When asked for a song that reminded him of growing up, Bill paused. He couldn't quite recall the name, but began to describe the way it sounded, the instruments played, and the way it felt. We searched through Spotify together and the second he heard "Bridge over troubled water," he knew it was the one.

Bill loved all the songs of Simon & Garfunkel during his time in the Peace Corps. He remembers listening to them with a friend he called "a kid," Greg, who played their music often. But that memory is also tied to heartbreak and the crashing reality of some difficult times in Bill's life. Greg died of pulmonary edema stationed at extremely high altitudes in Bolivia. His best friend, who eventually took over his masonry business, was caring for Greg when he passed and even years later, Bill could recall every detail. Bill remembers clear as day how "Bridge Over Troubled Water" sounded as he looked out a window over the highest road in Bolivia at nearly 18,000 feet, just before Greg's passing. Years later, Bill named his own son's middle name after Greg.  

For Bill, "Bridge Over Troubled Water" holds it all: youth, friendship, loss, finding yourself, and the kind of memory that doesn't fade. Some songs don't just remind us of the past, they hold memories that shape who we are.`,

She remembered first hearing it at as a vibrant 6-year-old as her and her sister jumped on their parents' beds, the upbeat tune echoing through the house. Born and raised in Portland, Greta practically grew up inside the bakery. Her bright spirit, shaped by a love-filled home and a mom who turned a diagnosis into a dream, is evident in everything from her smile to the frosting on the cinnamon roll (probably the best gluten free thing I've ever had). The song, "Our House," clearly embodies her family's sprit of kindness and love that the bakery is built upon.

    fullStory: `We met 20-year-old Carlos at Los Amigos Burrito in Florence, Oregon, a family-owned restaurant that has been serving authentic Mexican food for over 20 years. From the moment we walking in, the atmosphere felt personal: colorful walls, flags and maps to show origin, and music give the sense that generations of hard work have passed through the kitchen. Carlos had been working there for about 5 years, helping his family continue to build its business.

When asked for a song that reminded him of growing up, Carlos chose "Thriller" by Michael Jackson. He specifically described his uncle showing him the "zombie music video" as a young and thinking it was creepy, but unforgettable. Carlos spent a lot of time with that uncle, who unfortunately passed away about a year ago. Carlos recalled his favorite memory as playing football with his uncle, a small act that clearly still means a lot. He believes Los Amigos is special simply because the food is good. Carlos plans on leaving the small-town life soon to work with his family in Seattle, helping with their drywall business. But something about the way he spoke of the restaurant and memories with his uncle made it clear that no matter where he goes next, a part of him will always be rooted there: in good food, family, and the "Thriller" music video in the background of growing up.`,

    shortStory: '55-year-old Arielle connects to her German heritage through "The Lawrence Welk Show Closing Credits," which reminds her of her refugee father. After years of feeling disconnected, she\'s finally found her home in Oregon\'s forests.',
    fullStory: `We met 55-year-old Arielle at the Portland Japanese Garden during a public tour, surrounded by the blooming cherry blossoms and soft sound of waterfalls. She had such an open and curious energy, asking us many questions about our goals, travels, and even offering to connect us with her son for a test flight on our next trip (stay tuned to hear more about that!) 

When asked our usual question about a song that reminds her of growing up. She answered without hesitation, "The Lawrence Welk Show Closing Credits." The song brings back a sense of nostalgia, not just because of the music, but because Lawrence Welk speaks with a distinct German accent, reminding Arielle of her father. The daughter of refugees from Kussel, Germany, she said it made her feel connected back to her heritage and seen. "It always connected me back to the Motherland," she shared. It gave her a rare sense of feeling more connected to what she saw on American television. 

Arielle spent her early years in a bilingual town of Michigan, surrounded by a tight-knit German-speaking community. But when her father's job brought their family to Indiana, the shift was stark. She described it as being from a German pseudo-world into a place where she looked like everyone, but never felt like she truly belonged. That feeling of disconnection stayed with her much of her life, always in a quiet search for a place that felt like home. 

She went on to raise two sons in Cincinnati, where her husband's job brought them. Originally a hospice nurse, Arielle stepped away from that career after finding the work environment disheartening. In the last six months, she's taken time to explore Oregon: soaking in its forests, finding a new personality for each piece of the coastline, and enjoying a quiet, nature-filled lifestyle. She says she has finally found home in the trees of the Pacific Northwest. The Oregon coast reminds Arielle of her Michigan roots as she talks to the ocean, the wind, the birds, and dives headfirst into the spirit of nature. 

Arielle is letting life unfold. She is drawn to things that bring joy and meaning: volunteering with horse therapy, immigration advocacy, working with housing commission, maybe even venture capital. She's letting the universe guide her, one step at a time. And as for that old closing song on TV? For Arielle, it's still playing: a bridge between where she came from and where she has finally arrived.`,

    shortStory: '32-year-old A.D. has built his life around Portland\'s hospitality scene, but after his first real vacation to Chicago, he\'s ready for a change. His childhood song, first played by his aunt Elizabeth, connects him to his roots.',
    fullStory: `We met 32-year-old A.D. on a vibrant afternoon in Portland at Eem, a Thai restaurant buzzing with music, chatter, and the warm hum of energy. He was behind the bar, completely in his element, moving around to create unique drinks with the kind of grace that only comes from someone who loves what they do. After our meal (which did not disappoint), we struck up a conversation that quickly turned into a story.

A.D., short for Adrian, was born and right there in Portland. He's built a life rooted in the city by friends and family, but his eyes are starting to wander. When asked what song reminded him of growing up, he paused only briefly before landing on "Always Be My Baby by Mariah Carey. His aunt Elizabeth used to play it on repeat, and A.D. around 6 at the time, soaked it in. Mariah's spirit and vocals lured him in and it has been a grounding force for him ever since. "I kinda grew up with her," he told us, explaining how The Emancipation of Mimi later deepened his love for her music.

A.D. has been working in hospitality since he was a teenager. He fell in love with hospitality at age 14, and since then, he's worked all through the city: college events, fine dining, even bartending at a retirement center. But Eem, where he started as a server and now bartends full-time, has been his favorite. It's fast-paced, full of energy, and the staff is truly a team. During those rushes, EEM transforms into what he calls a "high-energy machine," and he thrives as a key part of it. Comfort in chaos. Of course, not every moment is perfectly polished. He laughed as he recalled one night behind the bar, feeling a little too confident with the cocktail shaker, only to smack himself square in the forehead. The result? A bright blue Band-Aid and an early end to his shift. It's those moments‚Äîboth chaotic and comical‚Äîthat make the job feel real, and memorable.

Still, change is calling. After his first real vacation to Chicago, he knew it was time. Portland will always be home, but A.D. wishes to see more, meet new people, and experience more of the world. Chicago's vibe, especially downtown, felt like it was calling to him. Now he's planning to move, hoping to bring his bartending skills and upbeat attitude to a new city. When we asked what drew him to hospitality in the first place, his answer was simple: "I love talking to people." He's found confidence behind the bar, learned how to hold space for others, and grown into himself in the process.

He also left us with a reminder that felt like the heart of everything he'd shared.
"Tell the people you love that you love them. For real. Life's short."

Back at the bar, the ice is rattling, the music is playing, and A.D. is already mixing whatever comes next.`,

Tatum played a huge part in crafting our night‚Äîmemorizing Emily's long list of allergies, recommending unforgettable dishes, and making us feel fully cared for throughout the entire meal.

When we asked what song reminded her of growing up, Tatum paused for a moment, then straight up sang the melody to us right there in the restaurant. A few taps on Spotify later‚Äîdon't worry, Tatum, we got you‚Äîit turned out to be "Apologize" by OneRepublic. She first heard it around five years old in 2004 and remembered loving the way it sounded.

Originally from San Diego, Tatum moved to Portland after falling in love with the city during a visit and deciding she needed a change. She's always worked in dining and finds comfort in the fast pace and controlled chaos of the restaurant world. She thrives on connection, enjoying the rhythm of ten-hour shifts and the chance to interact with people every day.

When we asked what she's learned along the way, she told us: "Common sense is not as common as I thought it was." She's also learned how much people carry beneath the surface‚Äîand how powerful it can be to look a little deeper.

She left us with two mottos she lives by:
"Go in with intention, not expectation."
"Find joy in the mundane."

And somehow, her words hit just as hard as the meal itself.`,

    fullStory: `We met 33-year-old Nina at Phaya, a bright and stylish gluten-free Thai restaurant in Portland that she runs with her sister. The space had a calm, welcoming vibe: open layout, soft LED lights, and a kind of energy that makes you want to stay a little longer. Nina greeted us with a warm smile and friendly openness. "I'm not very good at English," she gently admitted, "but I will try." And try she did, offering a story full of care and memory.

When we asked what song reminded her of growing up, she hesitated, clear in her mind but struggling to remember the name. Then she began humming, even turning to a coworker, trying to place the melody. When it clicked, "Yesterday Once More" by the Carpenters, she lit up. Originally from Surat Thani in Southern Thailand, Nina first heard the song around 8 years old. Her English teacher played it during a lesson, using its lyrics to help students understand grammar and pronunciation. For Nina, it wasn't just a song; it was her first real connection to the English language. Thesoft vocals and nostalgic tone take her back to school in Thailand, reminding Nina of her roots and how far she has come.

The restaurant itself carries similar echoes of childhood and cultural roots. Nina and her sister, Wala Shai, were inspired by the fast-casual Thai meals their parents used to treat them to when they were young. When they moved to Portland just over a year ago, they wanted to recreate that. And because Wala is gluten free, they made sure Phaya would be a place where people with dietary restrictions could still enjoy comforting Thai flavors without compromise.

Nina has built something new in a city far from where she started. Her restaurant, Phaya, feels warm and inviting, filled with the same kind of comfort and care that shaped her early memories. In a way, it's like that Carpenters song‚Äîgentle, familiar, and full of heart. Even across languages and continents, music and food have a way of staying with us, reminding us where we came from and how far we've traveled.`,

    shortStory: '33-year-old Zach turned his high school screen-printing hobby into a decade-long career in retail and fashion. His love for "This is the Day" began during a casual day in Newport Beach and remains his perfect summer soundtrack.',
    fullStory: `On our final day in Portland, we took a break from chasing waterfalls and tourist attractions to simply wander through the city. That's when we met 33-year-old Zach at Brain Dead, a storefront that exudes effortless style. Inside, it felt like art had come alive in clothing form, with unique pieces on every hanger. Zach had an easygoing, friendly energy that made us want to learn more. Before we could even ask, he was already sharing his favorite stops along the Columbia River Gorge and giving tips for the drive back.

When asked what song reminded him of growing up, Zach answered without hesitation. "This is the Day" by The The. He first heard it at around 13-years-old while hanging out in Newport Beach. It was a casual moment, just hanging around the beach town on a nice day, when he heard the song and had to ask someone what it was. Since then, he says it has stuck with him as a go-to summer track. Its minimal vocals allows the sound itself to flow through, uplifting and the perfect pick me up. "It guides you through the day in a good way," he told us.

Zach grew up in Orange, California, not far from where that beach memory stemmed from. His journey into clothing fashion started right in high school with screen printing: making bootleg shirts, printing merch for friends, and a desire to wear something he created. That creative expression eventually led to a decade-long career in retail, manufacturing, and management. It took him to Portland seven years ago when REI asked him run their downtown location before it eventually shut down.

These days, only a few weeks into working at Brain Dead, he thinks it already feels right. The clothing expression, and mostly conversations with different people keep him inspired and in the industry. Zach doesn't know what the next few years hold, but for now, he's living in the moment. He carries the same feeling of "This is the Day," taking each day as new, uplifting, and part of the journey.`,

    fullStory: `We only stepped into Mutantis Brewery looking for a bathroom while waiting for food, but what we found was something far more unexpected: a space pulsing with personality. The second we walked in, we knew we found something special. Neon tape lined the walls, handmade signs hung like battle flags, and a quiet stillness in the air that only exists when something is nearing its end. The bar was closing.

That's where we met 42-year-old Deja Indigo Yerger, who founded Mutantis in 2019 and opened it to the public in 2020. A queer- and trans-owned, gluten-free vegan brewery, it was built with intention. Not to be mainstream or to make a fortune, but rather to create a space where people could be unapologetically themselves. "I wouldn't be the person I am today if I'd never done this," she told us.

When we asked what song that reminded Deja of growing up, her answer came easily: "Rocket" by The Smashing Pumpkins. She first heard it in middle school, and the lyrics and meaning has stayed with her ever since. "Consumed the love to power the hate/And only powers my escape," she recited. That line in particular became a mantra, anchoring her back to childhood and the "sense of wanting to escape something from my life" she explained. For Deja, it was about finding a way out of whatever box the world continuously tried to place her in. It's a song about resistance, movement, and the fight to say true to yourself, even if it goes against what is conventional.

Deja's love for beer began in her early twenties, before being diagnosed with celiac disease. Rather than give it up, she took it as a challenge that pushed her forward to create gluten-free beer when no one else was. It wasn't about capitalizing on a niche. It was about survival and creating something inclusive for people like her. Though Mutantis never found financial success, it became something meaningful nonetheless. Through it, Deja built deep friendships, found community, and created a space that remained radically open even in the face of hate.

Now, with the bar preparing to close, Deja is turning to something new. She's training to become an electrologist, hoping to offer affirming, personal care, especially to fellow trans people who deserve to feel safe and comfortable in their own bodies. It's work that could be both more sustainable and fulfilling in a world that continues to question her identity. Though the doors of Mutantis may be closing, her search for community, purpose, and connection continues.

Before we left, we asked if she had any final words to share. "Get off Facebook. Get off Instagram. Get off TikTok. Get off Reddit. Get off Tumblr. Get off everything owned by billionaires." Even in her closing thoughts, Deja's spirit shone through: unfiltered, unwavering, and still fighting to create the kind of world that is deserved.`,

    fullStory: `We met Lilith Hope on a rainy Portland afternoon at a neighborhood bar nearing its final summer. She was there to see an old friend, the bar's proprietor, and share recent studies she'd completed‚Äîpart of a larger personal journey through faith, ancestry, and global history. Though she works as a federal employee, Lilith spoke more like a philosopher, a truth-seeker, a storyteller.

When we asked what song reminded her of growing up, she paused only briefly before naming "The Ballad of Davy Crockett." Her mother bought her the 45 rpm single in 1978, and Lilith remembers the way her mom would sing it often. "She wanted to be a mountain woman," she told us with a grin. That dream traced back through generations‚Äîher family came from the Appalachian Mountains, moved down to Georgia during the Dust Bowl, and carried with them their songs, stories, and deeply rooted traditions. Though the tune came from a Disney show, it captured something more personal: a heritage of resilience, pride, and survival.

Lilith is 54 and has lived in 33 different places, from the United States to Russia to Kyrgyzstan‚Äîa country she holds close to her heart and has tattooed on her chest. "I'm a sojourner," she told us. Her father worked for IBM, a codebreaker during the Cold War and one of the original engineers behind the ENIAC computer. His job meant constant moves‚Äî"IBM stood for 'I've Been Moved,'" she joked‚Äîbut it also exposed Lilith to different cultures, languages, and a global view of history.

She's spent much of her life studying the stories we inherit‚Äîhow we got here, what keeps repeating, and how we might find peace through understanding. Her spiritual views are shaped by curiosity more than doctrine; she's explored many faiths and now identifies as a solitary Christian, believing in a higher power and the ancestors who came before. For Lilith, family isn't about biology‚Äîit's about safety, trust, and shared love. Her partner, her children, her ex-wife, and the friends she's made along the way? All family.

"Whatever's on the other side," she said quietly, "that's where our family is. And we want to be there with them. But for now, we live. We love. We remember."

And somewhere in her memory, her mother still hums "Davy Crockett"‚Äîa song of mountains, movement, and making it through.`,

    shortStory: '20-year-old Oliver works as a parking attendant at Multnomah Falls after returning to Portland from San Francisco. Their song, which they\'ve known since childhood, resonates differently now as they navigate life changes and find stability with their partners.',
    fullStory: `We met 20 year-old Oliver just outside the iconic viewpoint at Multnomah Falls, with the mist still clinging to the mountainside and the air filled with the kind of quiet that only precedes rain. The roar of the waterfall echoed softly behind us, and a train was slowly approaching, making its way through the gorge. Oliver stood at the edge of the parking lot, wrapped in a bright orange safety vest and filled the air with an openness that drew us in to learning more of their story.

When we asked what song reminded them of growing up, they thoughtfully paused, offering two. One was "Little Bug" by Army of the Navy. But the other came with more certainty: "Landslide" by Fleetwood Mac. They'd been listening to it since they were around six or seven, usually in their mom's old car. The lyrics didn't fully land at first, more so the melody drew them in, but the song lingered and grew in meaning with maturity and time.

Years later, Oliver says the song resonates differently. They explain that "Landslide" is about growing older, facing change, and holding both the grief and the possibility that come with it. And for someone who's been moving through their own kind of shift, it makes sense. School hadn't been the right fit for Oliver. They came home to Portland after some time in San Francisco, moved back in with family, and reset to step out on their own again. Recently, they and their partners found a new apartment, leaving behind a chaotic roommate situation in hopes of something calmer and stable.

Working as a parking lot attendant at Multnomah wasn't part of a grand plan. They just needed a job, but there was something full circle about being here. Oliver found themself back in a place they'd grown up so close to but never truly explored or appreciated. Change has always felt difficult for Oliver, but necessary. In a way, finding themself here felt like taking back time they hadn't used before, a second chance in both experience and intention.

We asked what advice they'd give to the world, it was simple: Be kind. Everyone's doing their best, they said, and kindness costs nothing.

As we walked away, the sound of water filled the air again, and the falls poured steadily along the cliffside. The moment felt like the song itself: soft, reflective, and quietly powerful. Like change, nature keeps moving, and so do we.`,
